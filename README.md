### 🚀 What’s inside

| Layer | Tech Highlights |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, vanilla CSS (dark gradient theme), Font Awesome |
| **Infrastructure (paused)** | Terraform ⇒ GCP (Cloud Run/Functions, Cloud Build, Firestore, IAM) — hardened with tfsec & Checkov |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions with OIDC → GCP, SBOM & security scanning |
| **Hosting (current)** | **GitHub Pages** – static *“oasis”* mode until Google’s free tier reaches the Saudi region |

### 📜 Roadmap

- ✔️ **Project 1:** Everything-as-Code + Secure CI/CD  
- 🔄 **Project 2:** Helm-packaged app on GKE *(in progress – see banner on site)*  
- ☁️ Reactivate dynamic visitor counter once GCP free tier lands in the Middle East
